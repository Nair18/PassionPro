## 💁‍♂️ Purpose of building this app
<p>
This app was built with a purpose of solving a problem, digitising small-medium gyms. We wanted to build a one-stop-solution software for all training/fitness centers from on-boarding clients to manage their online presence. Due to some reasons we couldnt continue with this work and now we have decided to open source it. Overall its a full-fledged app that anyone can get started with.
