# Full-fledged ready-to-use multi-tenant gym management app built in react-native 
<p>The project has 50+ screens and actions. 
The backend of this project is powered by Java Springboot, contributed by https://github.com/atulkgupta9.</p>

<br><b>Purpose of building this app</b><br>
<p>
This app was built with a purpose of solving a problem in mind, by me and my batchmate(atulkgupta9). We wanted to build a one-stop-solution software for all training/fitness centers from on-boarding clients to manage their online presence. We had good technical knowledge to build it but lacked business skills. We couldn't convert our idea into a workable business model. This project has some things that are private and I feel not correct to reveal publicly. Overall its a full-fledged app that anyone can get started with.
</p>
<br><b>Who can use this app</b><br>
<p>
<p> App supports 3 logins -- Owner, Trainer, Client. 
<ul>
<li>Gym Owners 
	<p>Manage your clients, trainers, trainer salaries, personal training clients, keep track of gym's income and much more. Manage multiple gyms at one place.</p></li>
<li>Personal Trainers
	<p>Easily manage your online clients. Create and share meal and workout plans, send messages, create fitness packages, track income generated and much more.</p></li>
<li>Gym Clients
	<p>Clients can view the free/premium plans provided by their gyms/personal trainers. Can log their daily workouts(Exercie, weight lifted, time spent, calories burnt). Track weight, fat percentage. View pdfs of their workout/meal plans. Keep track of their membership plans and expiry.</p></li>
</ul>
